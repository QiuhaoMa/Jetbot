# Jetbot
teleoperate and automatic mode

This report includes remote operation and automatic mode, code and data of these two modes, as well as photos and process of our project.

Teleoperate is that we control the action of the jetbot through the xbox handle.

The automatic mode is carried out through the learning ability of the machine itself, and the machine learning is realized through taking pictures.
